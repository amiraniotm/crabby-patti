This is an early version of my first platformer - Crabby Patti vs The World!
It is a clone from an old Mario game. Hit platforms from below to flip
enemies and then go kick them before they recover! Save your crab friends
from the evil scaly hands of corporate reptilians!

The main character (Crabby Patti) was designed by @van___van (instagram)
and adapted to pixel art by me!
